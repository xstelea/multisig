# Foundation Transition Context

## Background

In 2026, the Radix Foundation is transitioning from a centralized operational model to a community-led approach. This shift comes after navigating challenging market conditions and internal restructuring in 2025.

## Key Elements

**Community-Led RFP Model**
The Foundation is transitioning to a Request for Proposal (RFP) model where the community takes on roles traditionally managed by the Foundation — including marketing, business development, and infrastructure.

**Financial Position**
The Foundation has sufficient fiat reserves to cover routine operating costs and does not plan to sell its XRD holdings. This allows the transition to proceed without financial pressure.

**Foundation Wind-Down**
The Foundation aims to ensure a smooth transition so that the bedrock of the Radix ecosystem remains reliable and ecosystem projects are supported with minimal disruption.

## What This Means for the Consultation dApp

The Consultation dApp is how the community makes decisions. As the Foundation steps back, this tool becomes critical infrastructure for:

- Deciding how community funds are allocated
- Approving RFPs and grants
- Making protocol-level decisions
- Coordinating ecosystem initiatives

The v2 redesign prioritizes decentralization precisely because the dApp must function without ongoing Foundation involvement.
