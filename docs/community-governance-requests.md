# Community Governance Requests

Source: [Governance tools and processes needed - RadixTalk](https://radixtalk.com/t/governance-tools-and-processes-needed/2119)

Summary of governance features requested by the community (Peachy Shawn).

## Governance App Features

**Voting power:**

- Vote based on validator-staked holdings (LSU) shown as XRD-equivalent

**Vote delegation:**

- Delegate to multiple people by percentage (e.g., 50% to one person, 10% to four others)
- Delegation expiry — delegations expire after a time period (e.g., 1 year) to prevent "set and forget"

**History & transparency:**

- Archive of RFP voting activity numbered sequentially
- Sorting options: by total voting power, personal stake, delegated stake

**Reference model:** [Uniswap governance](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/)

## Governance Process (Proposed)

**Phase 1: RFC (Request for Comment)**

- Forum post on [RadixTalk Radix Community DAO](https://radixtalk.com/c/governance/radix-community-dao/)
- Community discusses and votes on RFC
- Thresholds TBD

**Phase 2: RFP (Request for Proposal)**

- If RFC passes, moves to official RFP vote in Governance App
- Thresholds TBD

Note: This mirrors Uniswap's process but specifics (thresholds, quorum, voting periods) are not yet defined.

## Treasury App Features

- M-of-N multisig for sending assets
- Approvers selected via RFC/RFP process with term limits
- Each transfer must reference an approved RFP number
- Read-only visibility for non-administrators

## Scope Note

These requests are more ambitious than the current v2 proposal. The v2 proposal focuses on a minimal, decentralized voting tool. Features like vote delegation, LSU-based voting, and treasury management could be added in future iterations.
