# Consultation v2 — Product Scope Document

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Consultation v2

**Purpose:** Decentralized governance platform for Radix community decision-making, replacing the Foundation-dependent v1 system before 2026 wind-down.

**Components:**

1. **Consultation dApp** — TanStack Start web app for creating/voting/viewing governance items
2. **Vote Collector** — Node.js CLI for calculating vote results from on-ledger data

**Core Flow:**

```
Anyone creates TC → Community votes For/Against →
If passes (quorum + majority) → Admin promotes to RFP →
Community votes on options → Winner determined
```

**Tech Stack:**

- dApp: TanStack Start, Radix dApp Toolkit, PostgreSQL
- Vote Collector: Node.js, Radix Gateway API, PostgreSQL
- Smart Contracts: Scrypto (existing)
- Network: Configurable (Stokenet / Mainnet)

## 5. Vote Collector

### 5.1 Purpose

Node.js CLI that calculates vote results by:

1. Reading votes from on-ledger governance contract state
2. Fetching LSU holdings for each voter at snapshot time
3. Converting LSU → XRD voting power via validator redemption rates
4. Storing calculated results in PostgreSQL

### 5.2 Data Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
